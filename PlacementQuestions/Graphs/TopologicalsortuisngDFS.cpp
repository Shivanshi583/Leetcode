/*
Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with V vertices and E edges, Find any Topological Sorting of that Graph.


Example 1:

Input:

Output:
1
Explanation:
The output 1 denotes that the order is
valid. So, if you have, implemented
your function correctly, then output
would be 1 for all test cases.
One possible Topological order for the
graph is 3, 2, 1, 0.
Example 2:

Input:

Output:
1
Explanation:
The output 1 denotes that the order is
valid. So, if you have, implemented
your function correctly, then output
would be 1 for all test cases.
One possible Topological order for the
graph is 5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 0.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function topoSort()  which takes the integer V denoting the number of vertices and adjacency list as input parameters and returns an array consisting of a the vertices in Topological order. As there are multiple Topological orders possible, you may return any of them. If your returned topo sort is correct then console output will be 1 else 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V).


Constraints:
2 ≤ V ≤ 104
1 ≤ E ≤ (N*(N-1))/2
